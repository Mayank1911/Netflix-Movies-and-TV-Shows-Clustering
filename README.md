## Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering

As movie industry is evolving into streaming platforms, there’s no doubt that Netflix has become one of the important platforms for streaming. The dataset that we have used for EDA and clustering has been collected by Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. There are 12 features and around 7700 observations in the dataset and are mostly textual features

Our main objectives of this project are to do exploratory analysis and find useful insights from dataset, to understand what type content is available in different countries, also to find out is Netflix has increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years and at last to do clustering of similar content by matching text-based features from dataset.

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
